			<h2 class="thebeanerh2"> And the first Beaner was born</h2>
			<p class="paragraphthebeaner">The night Ana got to her new home in Argentina she was bombarded with new ways of seing the world. Thus she found herself looking for the best materials and crew to make her dream come to live. She went all over town in Buenos Aires and as she got to a library tired of looking at the same materials she tried to relax. Thats where she realized she was the one who had to do it or nobody was going to do it for her. And that's how the first Beaner was born, in 2016 and the idea was pitched perfectly. A true dream come true story</p>
